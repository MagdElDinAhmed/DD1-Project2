This Github repository is dedicated to our Digital Design 1 project
The project is to create a digital alarm clock using Verliog code to run on an FPGA Basys 3 board

How to use:
The center button is used to switch between clock mode to dispaly the time and adjust mode to adjust the clock time and the alarm time

The left and right buttons are used to change which part of the time is adjusted: 
If LD15 lights up, you're adjusting the clock hour
If LD14 lights up, you're adjusting the clock minutes
If LD13 lights up, you're adjusting the alarm hours
If LD12 lights up, you're adjusting the alarm minutes

The up and down buttons are used to increment or decrement the value being adjusted

If the clock reaches the time set for the alarm, LD0 blinks and the buzzer makes a beeping sound
Pressing any button diables the alarm


Note: reason most commits are done by MagdElDin AbdalRaaof is because we were working on one device, therefore only one person was really able to
upload the work on Github
